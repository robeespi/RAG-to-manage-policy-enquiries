# RAG-to-manage-policy-enquiries
A technology firm has successfully implemented an internal assistant designed to manage complex inquiries related to a wide range of policy documents. These documents include structured and unstructured content such as tables, graphs, and images. The assistant operates using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, enabling it to parse, retrieve, and generate responses directly from specific policy documents with high contextual accuracy.

The RAG system reliably retrieves relevant policy data to deliver precise, context-aware answers. A core design principle of the system prioritizes reliability: in scenarios where the model lacks sufficient confidence, it is engineered to return no response rather than risk delivering incorrect or misleading information.

Key Features of the Solution:

1. Framework Architecture:
A detailed development roadmap guided the construction of the RAG model. This included exploratory data analysis (EDA), high-level system design, and selection of a technology stack tailored to the unique requirements of the policy documents. The framework also defined what types of data inputs improved system accuracy and documented the relevant tools, methodologies, and implementation phases. While proprietary insights were excluded due to NDA constraints, the public-facing framework highlights flexible, modular approaches to building domain-specific RAG systems.

2. RAG Model Implementation:
The RAG pipeline was implemented using the specified framework. For transparency and educational purposes, the core workflow is shared via a Jupyter notebook, which details infrastructure setup, algorithm selection, data preprocessing steps, and integration with retrieval mechanisms. The production version of the assistant incorporates object-oriented programming principles and ML operations pipelines for deployment and scalability. Open-source tools and libraries were leveraged where applicable to ensure reproducibility and community contribution.

3. Evaluation Strategy:
A robust evaluation protocol is in place to ensure ongoing performance. The testing framework includes a variety of scenarios and edge cases representative of real-world policy queries. Key metrics focus on accuracy, relevance, and response reliability. The system is monitored post-deployment with tools for continuous evaluation and feedback, supporting both incremental improvements and sustained model performance over time.
